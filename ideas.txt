1. Shannon Sampling theorem
2. Cannot increase Cp and Cv practically. Cp - 1000 to 4000, Cv - 50 to 100 , Cf - 30 to 70, Cy is very small - 5 to 15. 
3. Laplace transform - solving differential equation
4. Positions and velocities should follow one another, Forces should be opposing - how to check algorythm works.
